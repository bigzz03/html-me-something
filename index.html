                   <h2>Computers</h2>
                   <p>I was first introduced to computers when I was 10 years old. 
                       My dad was raising my sister and I and we had just moved out 
                       to St. Peters from Overland.  I had lost all my friends, and 
                       was bored and sat inside a lot.  A friend of my dad's from his 
                       work sold him our very first computer.  It was an experience that 
                       essentially paved the path for my future.  At the time it was a 
                       really fast computer with 64mb of ram and a x386 processor.  We 
                       had no internet nor did it even have windows on it.  All it had 
                       was DOS and command lines.  My dad's friend also gave him a copy 
                       of Doom and Decent, which were the first 2 video games I ever played 
                       on a computer.  To date, there is no one single thing I have spent 
                       more time in my life doing outside of playing video games, probably 
                       not even sleep.</p>

                   <h3>Cars</h3>
                   <p>Even though computers were the first love of my life, cars were soon
                       to follow.  From age 10 to 15 nothing existed but computers and video games.
                       When I hit 15, I began learning how to drive.  I was always facinated by Cars
                       and going fast.  Around the time I turned 15 and a half my dad let me pick out
                       and bought me my very first car.  It was a 1988 Buick LeSabre T-Type.  It had
                       a v6 3800 series II motor, which for me at that time was pretty quick.  The Buick LeSabre
                       was considered an "old person" car, but the T-Type was the sporty style.  It was
                       based off the Grand National.  We bought it from a friend at school, and it sat
                       in our driveway for 6 months until I turned 16 and got my license the day of.  I was free
                       and did nothing but drive around.  I was addicted to driving like I was playing video games,
                       I just drove to drive.  Being just a kid, I did a lot of stupid stuff, like racing around town,
                       doing burnouts in parking lots, etc.  Eventually the car couldn't take the beating and broke down.
                       The next car I bought was from a buddy of mine.  I purchased this car on my own, and it was a 1990
                       camaro RS.  It was my first real sports car.  This love for cars only continued.  My dad and I drove
                       to Kentucky to buy a 1968 Chevy Chevelle 396.  This car was beautiful and a beast.  We trailered it
                       home from Kentucky, and had fun with it.  We did a lot of restoration work on it from a cosmetic
                       standpoint.  There was an issue with one of the lifter channels, there was a bur that was rubbing
                       on the cam and caused a cam lobe to go flat on 2 different cams.  My dad finally decided we were going
                       to rebuild the engine completely.  I was insanely excited.  I got to disassemble the entire
                       motor all the way down to the crank, until the block was completely bare.  We then sent it 
                       down to Matt Johnson's shop to have it dipped and blueprinted.  We also bored it. 30 over.
                       We rebuilt the motor with a lot stronger parts and a massive cam.  When we finally finished and started
                       it for the first time it was one of the best moments of my life.  That car was a beast.  Shortly after
                       finishing the Chevelle, I purchased my own fast car, a 1996 Camaro z28 6 speed.  It had every bolt-on possible,
                       exhaust, headers, intake, etc.  It was a 12 second car without any motor work, which was pretty good for the
                       time.  Life changes led me to sell it, and I haven't had a hotrod since.  This is one of the large
                       driving forces for pushing into a new career.  I want to be financially stable, and be able to get another
                       hotrod, I miss it a lot.

                   <h4>Video Games</h4>
                   <p>Video Games are where my heart lies.  Cars are extremely important to me and love them a lot,
                       but nothing compares to video games for me.  It all started, as I mentioned previously, with Doom
                       and Decent.  The same year I got my first computer and learned about it, Windows 95 was released.
                       It was mind blowing.  Having a "user interface" to see files and folders and game icons was crazy.
                       I can't begin to tell you how many hours I had in breakout lol.  I couple years later, the internet
                       reached our area, and I was introduced to a whole new world on 14.4k speeds!  In 1998 video games 
                       were becoming better and better.  One specific game caught my attention, Everquest.  I was at friends
                       house and he was playing it.  After watching him play for what felt like forever, I immedately went home
                       and talked my dad into buying it for me.  This RPGMMO was unlike anything I had ever played before.  
                       I had always played first person shooter games like Doom.  To live in this online world and interact 
                       with other real people behind a character that I controlled was crazy.  I was submerged into this world 
                       of magic and mythical creatures and it was awesome.  From 13 to 16 if I was not at school I was glued to 
                       the computer non-stop playing Everquest.  In those times, I did mix it up with another great shooter game 
                       called Counter-Strike.  Counter-Strike was originally a mod for Half-life, and was awesome.  It Eventually 
                       was able to break away from Half-life mod, and become it's own game that went to retail.  I played Counter-Strike
                       at a very high level for a very long time, before the high scene was considered "Professional".  I have been 
                       playing Everquest and Counter-Strike for 20 years this year.  Yes, that's right, my first two games I played on 
                       the internet I still do this day, play.  I've played just about every type of game out there in those 20 years, but 
                       ALWAYS find myself back on either one of those two games.  There is a new game currently in development, of which 
                       I am a paying supporter of, called Pantheon.  I am hopeful this is the next Everquest beast.
