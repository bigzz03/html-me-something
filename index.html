                   <h2>Computers</h2>
                   <p>I was first introduced to computers when I was 10 years old. 
                       My dad was raising my sister and I and we had just moved out 
                       to St. Peters from Overland.  I had lost all my friends, and 
                       was bored and sat inside a lot.  A friend of my dad's from his 
                       work sold him our very first computer.  It was an experience that 
                       essentially paved the path for my future.  At the time it was a 
                       really fast computer with 64mb of ram and a x386 processor.  We 
                       had no internet nor did it even have windows on it.  All it had 
                       was DOS and command lines.  My dad's friend also gave him a copy 
                       of Doom and Decent, which were the first 2 video games I ever played 
                       on a computer.  To date, there is no one single thing I have spent 
                       more time in my life doing outside of playing video games, probably 
                       not even sleep.</p>

                   <h2>Cars</h2>
                   <p>Even though computers were the first love of my life, cars were soon
                       to follow.  From age 10 to 15 nothing existed but computers and video games.
                       When I hit 15, I began learning how to drive.  I was always facinated by Cars
                       and going fast.  Around the time I turned 15 and a half my dad let me pick out
                       and bought me my very first car.  It was a 1988 Buick LeSabre T-Type.  It had
                       a v6 3800 series II motor, which for me at that time was pretty quick.  The Buick LeSabre
                       was considered an "old person" car, but the T-Type was the sporty style.  It was
                       based off the Grand National.  We bought it from a friend at school, and it sat
                       in our driveway for 6 months until I turned 16 and got my license the day of.  I was free
                       and did nothing but drive around.  I was addicted to driving like I was playing video games,
                       I just drove to drive.  Being just a kid, I did a lot of stupid stuff, like racing around town,
                       doing burnouts in parking lots, etc.  Eventually the car couldn't take the beating and broke down.
                       The next car I bought was from a buddy of mine.  I purchased this car on my own, and it was a 1990
                       camaro RS.  It was my first real sports car.  This love for cars only continued.  My dad and I drove
                       to Kentucky to buy a 1968 Chevy Chevelle 396.  This car was beautiful and a beast.  We trailered it
                       home from Kentucky, and had fun with it.  We did a lot of restoration work on it from a cosmetic
                       standpoint.  There was an issue with one of the lifter channels, there was a bur that was rubbing
                       on the cam and caused a cam lobe to go flat on 2 different cams.  My dad finally decided we were going
                       to rebuild the engine completely.  I was insanely excited.  I got to disassemble the entire
                       motor all the way down to the crank, until the block was completely bare.  We then sent it 
                       down to Matt Johnson's shop to have it dipped and blueprinted.  We also bored it. 30 over.
                       We rebuilt the motor with a lot stronger parts and a massive cam.  When we finally finished and started
                       it for the first time it was one of the best moments of my life.  That car was a beast.  Shortly after
                       finishing the Chevelle, I purchased my own fast car, a 1996 Camaro z28 6 speed.  It had every bolt-on possible,
                       exhaust, headers, intake, etc.  It was a 12 second car without any motor work, which was pretty good for the
                       time.  Life changes led me to sell it, and I haven't had a hotrod since.  This is one of the large
                       driving forces for pushing into a new career.  I want to be financially stable, and be able to get another
                       hotrod, I miss it a lot.

                   <h2>Video Games</h2>
                   <p>Video Games are where my heart lies.  Cars are extremely important to me and love them a lot,
                       but nothing compares to video games for me.  It all started, as I mentioned previously, with Doom
                       and Decent.  The same year I got my first computer and learned about it, Windows 95 was released.
                       It was mind blowing.  Having a "user interface" to see files and folders and game icons was crazy.
                       I can't begin to tell you how many hours I had in breakout lol.  I couple years later, the internet
                       reached our area, and I was introduced to a whole new world on 14.4k speeds!  In 1998 video games 
                       were becoming better and better.  One specific game caught my attention, Everquest.  I was at friends
                       house and he was playing it.  After watching him play for what felt like forever, I immedately went home
                       and talked my dad into buying it for me.  This RPGMMO was unlike anything I had ever played before.  
                       I had always played first person shooter games like Doom.  To live in this online world and interact 
                       with other real people behind a character that I controlled was crazy.  I was submerged into this world 
                       of magic and mythical creatures and it was awesome.  From 13 to 16 if I was not at school I was glued to 
                       the computer non-stop playing Everquest.  In those times, I did mix it up with another great shooter game 
                       called Counter-Strike.  Counter-Strike was originally a mod for Half-life, and was awesome.  It Eventually 
                       was able to break away from Half-life mod, and become it's own game that went to retail.  I played Counter-Strike
                       at a very high level for a very long time, before the high scene was considered "Professional".  I have been 
                       playing Everquest and Counter-Strike for 20 years this year.  Yes, that's right, my first two games I played on 
                       the internet I still do this day, play.  I've played just about every type of game out there in those 20 years, but 
                       ALWAYS find myself back on either one of those two games.  There is a new game currently in development, of which 
                       I am a paying supporter of, called Pantheon.  I am hopeful this is the next Everquest beast.

                   <h2>Music</h2>
                   <p>
                     Music has always been something i've been pretty big into.  When I was in my teens and early 20s I went to quite a few 
                     concerts.  The music I listen to ranges anywhere from chillstep to hardcore metal or death metal and just about everything
                     in between.  However, there is one genre that I do not like at all nor even classify as music, and that is country.  I cannot
                     stand it, and when I hear it I want to leave where ever I am immediately.  The music I listen to all depends on my 
                     mood.  If i'm out and about at a club, or some type of event I enjoy to techno or rap, something with a good beat.  If i'm in 
                     the car cruising, it's usually some type of harder rock that I can sing to.  When at home on the computer chilling, it's usually 
                     some type of dubstep or chillstep.  From time to time, I need harder stuff like death metal and scream.  In the weird moods
                     I have been known to lean towards some bluegrass/folk type genre.  Whatever I'm doing, where ever I'm at, I enjoy listening to 
                     music.  90% of the time I can't stand not having some type of music playing.  It helps relax me, helps me focus, and just lets 
                     me chill out and enjoy what i'm currently doing.  My favorite music is rock from the early 2000s.  Bands like Soil, drowning pool, 
                     Linkin Park, Disturbed, Static-X, Sevendust, Five Finger Death Punch, and Chevelle.  I also really like Christin rock bands 
                     like Fuel, P.O.D., filter, Skillet, etc.  If I was stranded on an island for eternity and was able to bring 1 album only I would choose
                     The Sickness by Disturbed.  It is my all time favorite album.

                   <h2>Coding</h2>
                   <p>
                     Thoughout my computer involvement and gaming i've become familar with development and coding.  I've always hardcore
                     an interest in learning how to code.  It all started back in the day of the mIRC channels.  All the script wars that took 
                     place in those channels, and all the havic that was caused was just so interesting to me.  Then getting into MMOs was a new 
                     level of development and coding.  The fact that someone typing on a keyboard into a program could make the world that I was running
                     around in and interacting with everything in that world was just insane to think about.  Even though I haven't pushed for a career 
                     in coding I've always kept it close for the day that I make that push.  From building websites through dreamweaver and geocities to 
                     customizing UIs through XML files or writing .bat files for work.  I've always taken opportunities to learn something new with coding 
                     for the hope that one day I will make that push to my dream career.  In 2015 I was given an opportunity at work to go down a career path 
                     I was very interested in, Information Security.  With no degree, and only a GED, I took a position that was awesome.  The plan was to work 
                     towards being an Auditor in the Payment Card Industry.  I would be able to travel the world for free and Audit the industry i've known for 
                     the last 11 years of my life.  In 2017 the company was sold to a lot larger company and rules and plans changed.  Now if I want to continue 
                     down that path it's going to cost me tens of thousands of dollars and I would be forced to pay that out of pocket with no support from the 
                     previous owner who was going to pay for all of it.  Due to life and where my current budget is, I could not afford it, nor am I happy with the 
                     direction this company is going.  It was time for me to really take a step back and think about what I wanted to do.  I could not stay with this 
                     company that much longer, and after November, don't know what will happen.  So after a lot of thinking, I decided now was the perfect time 
                     to start down the path of learning to code for real and turning it into a career.  I immediately started researching jobs and pay and what I needed 
                     to do.  I decided Python seemed interesting and fun and could apply it to quite a few things I already know.  I started going through codeacademy 
                     and udemy picking up coarses and learning what I could.  After taking to a couple devs at work, one of them mentioned Launchcode.  I did some 
                     research on the company and what they were about, and was amazed how the coarse they had almost matched perfectly to the path I decided I wanted to 
                     take.  I applied, and now here I am, moving into Unit 2 of their coarse.  I'm that much closer to making a dream actually come true.  It's time.
